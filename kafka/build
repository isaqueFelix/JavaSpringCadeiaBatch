# Env Vars:
# REGISTRY: name of the image registry/namespace to store the images
# NOCACHE: set this to "--no-cache" to turn off the Docker build cache
#
# NOTE: to run this you MUST set the REGISTRY environment variable to
# your own image registry/namespace otherwise the `docker push` commands
# will fail due to an auth failure. Which means, you also need to be logged
# into that registry before you run it.

# Build the images
docker build ${NOCACHE} -f Dockerfile.sender -t ${REGISTRY}/kafka-sender .
docker build ${NOCACHE} -f Dockerfile.receiver -t ${REGISTRY}/kafka-receiver .

# And push it
docker push ${REGISTRY}/kafka-sender
docker push ${REGISTRY}/kafka-receiver
