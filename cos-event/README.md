# Cloud Object Storage

This sample shows how to create an IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) Event Source
and hook it up to an Application that will receive its events. An event is
sent for each successful change to an object in the COS bucket.

The `run` script will create the app and an event subscription connecting the
app to the specified COS bucket. The script will then upload a file to the
bucket, resulting in the generation of an event. On receipt of the event, the
app will log the event to stdout and increment a set of internal counters.
The script queries the app on the `/stats` endpoint and displays these
updated counters.

If you already have a COS instance that you want to use, you can set the
`COS_ID` environment variable to the CRN of that instance. You can find
existing instances by running
```
ibmcloud resource service-instances --service-name cloud-object-storage --long
```
If you want to use one of the listed instances, set `COS_ID` to the instance
CRN/ID (the value in the first column of each row). If you leave this
variable unset, the `run` script will attempt to create a `lite` (free of
charge) COS instance for you, which it will then delete upon completion. It
will not delete any existing instance you specify via the `COS_ID` variable.

As noted in [the main README](../README.md), this sample has two pieces:

- a `build` script which will build the container image(s) used
- a `run` script which deploys resources that use those images

The main purpose of this example is the `run` script, but the `build`
script is included for complete educational (and reuse) purposes.
